# ECOMMERCE-DATA-ANALYSIS

ðŸ“Š E-commerce Data Analysis using SQL and Python
Description:

This project focuses on performing in-depth data analysis of an E-commerce dataset using SQL for data extraction and Python for data cleaning, transformation, and visualization. The goal is to derive meaningful business insights to help understand customer behavior, product performance, order trends, and geographical sales distribution.

Tools & Technologies:

Database: MySQL

Languages: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

IDE: Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

Libraries: pandas, mysql-connector-python, matplotlib, seaborn

Key Objectives:

Import and manage structured datasets (e.g., customers, orders, products) into MySQL.

Use SQL queries to retrieve relevant business data (e.g., top cities, order counts, seller performance).

Clean and preprocess the data in Python using Pandas.

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualize key metrics like:

Top-selling products

Monthly sales trends

City-wise customer distribution

Payment method usage

Order delivery performance

Outcome:
This project demonstrates the integration of SQL and Python for real-world data analysis. It helps build data-driven decision-making skills by identifying patterns, trends, and actionable insights from large-scale E-commerce transactions.
